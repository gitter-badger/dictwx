Frank is now the head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop. It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day. He saved money for years and in 1938 he bought a small work-shop of his own. During the war Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes. At that time he had two helpers.

The temptation to steal is greater than ever before--especially in large shops. A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings. One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for the detective to watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible. Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop-assistant was her daughter.

He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner returned than he bought a fine house and went to live there. Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted as if he had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The dream he had had for so many years ended there.

After a time, we noticed a snake-charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him. As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets. When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake. It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe. We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz tunes and modern pop songs.

Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time. Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay below, they soon ran into serious trouble. At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash. It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet. Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet. Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more mountains in sight.

He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below. The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the mattress.

The list included most of the things Herbert loves: butter, potatoes, rice, beer, milk, chocolate, and sweets. Yesterday I paid him a visit. I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Herbert was still as fat as ever. He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.

He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally. Then he showed me the contents of the parcel.

Forest fire are often caused by broken glass or by cigarette ends which people carelessly throw away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. This morning, however, a fireman accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line. In this way, he was able to solve the mystery. The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.   \u6d88\u9632\u961f\u5458\u4eec\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6251\u706d\u4e86\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u7684\u4e00\u573a\u68ee\u6797\u5927\u706b\u3002\u4ece\u90a3\u65f6\u8d77\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u8bd5\u56fe\u627e\u51fa\u8d77\u706b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u68ee\u6797\u706b\u707e\u65f6\u5e38\u7531\u7834\u788e\u7684\u73bb\u7483\u6216\u4eba\u4eec\u968f\u624b\u6254\u6389\u7684\u9999\u70df\u5934\u5f15\u8d77\u3002\u6628\u5929\uff0c\u6d88\u9632\u961f\u5458\u4ed4\u7ec6\u67e5\u770b\u4e86\u5730\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u788e\u73bb\u7483\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5341\u5206\u80af\u5b9a\u706b\u707e\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u70df\u5934\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\u4eca\u5929\u4e0a\u5348\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u9632\u961f\u5458\u5076\u7136\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8d77\u706b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7f20\u7ed5\u572816,000\u4f0f\u9ad8\u538b\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u6b7b\u86c7\u3002\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4ed6\u89e3\u5f00\u4e86\u8d77\u706b\u4e4b\u8c1c\u3002\u89e3\u91ca\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5374\u5f02\u4e4e\u5bfb\u5e38\u3002\u4e00\u53ea\u9e1f\u628a\u86c7\u4ece\u5730\u4e0a\u6293\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u628a\u5b83\u6254\u5230\u4e86\u7535\u7ebf\u4e0a\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\u86c7\u5c31\u7f20\u4f4f\u4e86\u51e0\u6839\u7535\u7ebf\u3002\u5f53\u5b83\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u65f6\uff0c\u628a\u706b\u82b1\u9001\u5230\u4e86\u5730\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u706b\u82b1\u7acb\u523b\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u5927\u706b\u3002        ";

A new machine called 'The Revealer' has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground. The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where--it is said--pirates used to hide gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk. In spite of this, many people are confident that 'The Revealer' may reveal something of value fairly soon.   \u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5931\u8e2a\u5b9d\u85cf\u7684\u68a6\u60f3\u5dee\u4e00\u70b9\u513f\u53d8\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u4e00\u79cd\u53eb\u201c\u63a2\u5b9d\u5668\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d1\u660e\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u88ab\u4eba\u4eec\u7528\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5730\u4e0b\u57cb\u85cf\u7684\u91d1\u5b50\u3002\u5728\u9760\u8fd1\u6d77\u8fb9\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u636e\u8bf4\u8fc7\u53bb\u6d77\u76d7\u5e38\u5728\u91cc\u9762\u85cf\u91d1\u5b50\u7684\u5ca9\u6d1e\u91cc\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u88ab\u6d3e\u4e0a\u4e86\u7528\u573a\u3002\u6d77\u76d7\u4eec\u8fc7\u53bb\u5e38\u628a\u91d1\u5b50\u57cb\u85cf\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u6d1e\u91cc\uff0c\u53ef\u540e\u6765\u5374\u6ca1\u80fd\u53d6\u8d70\u3002\u4e00\u652f\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u88c5\u5907\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u63a2\u5b9d\u961f\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5ca9\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u57cb\u85cf\u7740\u7684\u91d1\u5b50\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e2a\u961f\u7684\u961f\u957f\u6b63\u5728\u68c0\u67e5\u6d1e\u53e3\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u65f6\uff0c\u90a3\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5b83\u7684\u4e0b\u9762\u57cb\u6709\u91d1\u5b50\u3002\u961f\u5458\u4eec\u5f02\u5e38\u6fc0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c31\u5730\u6316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u82f1\u5c3a\u6df1\u7684\u5751\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u540e\u627e\u5230\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u679a\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e00\u94b1\u4e0d\u503c\u7684\u5c0f\u91d1\u5e01\u3002\u961f\u5458\u4eec\u63a5\u7740\u53c8\u628a\u6574\u4e2a\u6d1e\u5f7b\u5e95\u641c\u5bfb\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u53ea\u7a7a\u94c1\u76ae\u7bb1\u5916\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e5f\u6ca1\u627e\u5230\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u4ecd\u7136\u76f8\u4fe1\u201c\u63a2\u5b9d\u5668\u201d\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u63a2\u51fa\u503c\u94b1\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u6765\u3002        ";

A lot of cars entered for this race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began. One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels. Built in 1885, it was the oldest car taking part. After a great many loud explosions, the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them ! A few cars, however, completed the race. The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour--much faster than any of its rivals. It sped downhill at the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it. The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure. It was very different from modern car races but no less exciting.    \u65e7\u5f0f\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u6c7d\u8f66\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd9\u9879\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5f00\u59cb\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5f02\u5e38\u6fc0\u52a8\u3002\u6700\u6f02\u4eae\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u7f57\u5c14\u65af--\u7f57\u4f0a\u65af\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u94f6\u9b3c\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u4e00\u8f86\u5219\u8981\u5c5e\u53ea\u67093\u53ea\u8f6e\u5b50\u7684\u5954\u9a70\u724c\u6c7d\u8f66\u4e86\u3002\u8be5\u8f66\u9020\u4e8e1885\u5e74\uff0c\u662f\u53c2\u8d5b\u8f66\u4e2d\u6700\u8001\u7684\u4e00\u8f86\u3002\u5728\u597d\u4e00\u9635\u55a7\u95f9\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u58f0\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u9014\u4e2d\u5c31\u629b\u4e86\u951a\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u4e9b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u82b1\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u5e95\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u5750\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd8\u957f\u3002\u7136\u800c\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u51e0\u8f86\u6c7d\u8f66\u8dd1\u5b8c\u4e86\u5168\u7a0b\u3002\u83b7\u80dc\u7684\u90a3\u8f86\u8f66\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65f6\u901f40\u82f1\u91cc--\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc7\u4efb\u4f55\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ec8\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u51b2\u4e0b\u4e86\u5c71\u5761\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u8d39\u4e86\u597d\u5927\u52b2\u624d\u628a\u8f66\u505c\u4e0b\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u633a\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002\u5b83\u867d\u7136\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5927\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u6fc0\u52a8\u4eba\u5fc3\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e9a\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6c7d\u8f66\u5927\u8d5b\u3002         ";

Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time with great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress.

Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased. The tree was planted near a church fifty years ago, but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation. It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said, the tourists-have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk.

Every time he wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate. As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate. However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. This time he was barking so that someone would let him out ! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.    \u6211\u5bb6\u7684\u72d7\u96f7\u514b\u65af\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u5e38\u5750\u5728\u5927\u95e8\u5916\u9762\u53eb\u3002\u6bcf\u5f53\u5b83\u60f3\u5230\u82b1\u56ed\u91cc\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u4fbf\u6c6a\u6c6a\u53eb\u4e2a\u4e0d\u505c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6709\u4eba\u628a\u95e8\u6253\u5f00\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u90bb\u5c45\u4eec\u5bf9\u72d7\u53eb\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4e08\u592b\u82b1\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b83\u7528\u811a\u722a\u6309\u4f4f\u95e8\u95e9\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u653e\u8fdb\u6765\u3002\u96f7\u514b\u65af\u5f88\u5feb\u6210\u4e86\u5f00\u95e8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u7136\u800c\u4e0a\u661f\u671f\u6211\u6b63\u8981\u51fa\u53bb\u4e70\u4e1c\u897f\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u6b63\u5446\u5728\u82b1\u56ed\u91cc\u8fb9\u9760\u95e8\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u5b83\u53eb\u7740\u8ba9\u4eba\u628a\u5b83\u653e\u51fa\u53bb\uff01\u4ece\u90a3\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u517b\u6210\u4e86\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u79cd\u574f\u4e60\u60ef\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u5916\u9762\u628a\u95e8\u4e00\u6253\u5f00\uff0c\u5c31\u8d70\u8fdb\u82b1\u56ed\uff0c\u7b49\u7740\u95e8\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e4b\u540e\u4ed6\u5c31\u5750\u4e0b\u6c6a\u6c6a\u53eb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6709\u4eba\u6765\u628a\u5b83\u653e\u51fa\u53bb\u3002\u51fa\u53bb\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u53c8\u9a6c\u4e0a\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u653e\u8fdb\u6765\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u518d\u5f00\u59cb\u53eb\u3002\u6628\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4e08\u592b\u628a\u95e8\u5378\u4e86\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u96f7\u514b\u65af\u5f88\u751f\u6c14\uff0c\u6b64\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u4fbf\u518d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u89c1\u5230\u5b83\u3002            ";

The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you know well will rush towards you. She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place. That is all.'

The spaceship Astra which left the earth a short time ago, will be travelling three hundred miles into space. At a certain point, the Astra will stop for a short time and an astronaut will attempt to leave the stationary spaceship and then return to it. We shall not know whether the experiment has been successful until we have received a radio message. The first message is expected to arrive at 7 o'clock this evening.

Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well. When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly. The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes. The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root.

He prepared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny. He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success.

On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his surprise, she said she hadn't.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea-level. In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He suggested that a double railway tunnel should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. Recently, there has again been great interest in the idea of a Channel Tunnel. If it is built, it will connect Britain to Europe for the first time in history.   1858\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d\u540d\u53eb\u57c3\u6885.\u6258\u6885.\u5fb7.\u5e72\u8499\u7684\u6cd5\u56fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5e26\u7740\u5efa\u9020\u4e00\u6761\u957f21\u82f1\u91cc\u3001\u7a7f\u8d8a\u82f1\u5409\u5229\u6d77\u9655\u7684\u96a7\u9053\u8ba1\u5212\u5230\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u96a7\u9053\u4e2d\u592e\u5efa\u9020\u4e00\u5ea7\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u7528\u4f5c\u7801\u5934\u548c\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u3002\u5982\u679c\u518d\u5efa\u4e9b\u4f38\u51fa\u6d77\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u5927\u7684\u70df\u56f1\u72b6\u901a\u98ce\u7ba1\uff0c\u96a7\u9053\u5c31\u5177\u5907\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u30021860\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d\u540d\u53eb\u5a01\u5ec9.\u6d1b\u7684\u82f1\u56fd\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u4ed6\u63d0\u8bae\u5efa\u4e00\u6761\u53cc\u8f68\u96a7\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u98ce\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5217\u706b\u8f66\u5f00\u8fdb\u96a7\u9053\uff0c\u5b83\u5c31\u628a\u65b0\u9c9c\u7a7a\u6c14\u968f\u4e4b\u62bd\u8fdb\u4e86\u96a7\u9053\u300242\u5e74\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u96a7\u9053\u5b9e\u9645\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u5efa\u4e86\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u90a3\u65f6\u82f1\u56fd\u4eba\u5bb3\u6015\u5165\u4fb5\uff0c\u96a7\u9053\u65e9\u5df2\u5efa\u6210\u4e86\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u518d\u7b49\u5c06\u8fd1100\u5e74\u624d\u770b\u5230\u6d77\u5ce1\u96a7\u9053\u7ae3\u5de5\u3002\u5b83\u4e8e1994\u5e743\u67087\u65e5\u6b63\u5f0f\u5f00\u901a\uff0c\u5c06\u82f1\u56fd\u4e0e\u6b27\u6d32\u5927\u9646\u8fde\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u8d77\u3002    ";

He, should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side-street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street. The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused. 'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him.

The reason for this is that this plane is also a bicycle. Its pilot has to pedal hard to get it into the air. After Mr Wimpenny had the plane built, it was tested thoroughly. In 1961, it was the first man-powered aircraft to fly half a mile. While being flown by a champion amateur cyclist in 1963, the plane crashed on an airfield. Since then, Mr Wimpenny has had it rebuilt. He has had the length of the wings increased so that they now measure 93 feet--almost as long as those of a Dakota. Many people have shown interest in this new and unusual sport. But though air cyclists may learn how to fly over short distances, and may, eventually, even get across the English Channel, it is doubtful whether they will ever cycle across the Atlantic.   1963\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u67b6\u5170\u5f00\u65af\u7279\u8f70\u70b8\u673a\u5728\u74e6\u7acb\u65af\u5c9b\u6bc1\u3002\u90a3\u662f\u5357\u592a\u6d0b\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u504f\u50fb\u7684\u5c0f\u5c9b\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8428\u6469\u4e9a\u7fa4\u5c9b\u4ee5\u897f\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7fa4\u5c9b\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u957f\u4e00\u6bb5\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u98de\u673a\u635f\u574f\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u8fd9\u8d77\u98de\u673a\u5931\u4e8b\u5df2\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u98de\u673a\u6b8b\u9ab8\u4e5f\u6ca1\u53d7\u5230\u7834\u574f\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\uff0c\u5230\u4e861989\u5e74\uff0c\u98de\u673a\u5931\u4e8b26\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5c9b\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u822a\u7a7a\u52d8\u67e5\u4e2d\u90a3\u67b6\u98de\u673a\u88ab\u610f\u5916\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u3002\u5230\u4e86\u90a3\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u72b6\u51b5\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5170\u5f00\u65af\u7279\u8f70\u70b8\u673a\u5b9e\u5c5e\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u62a2\u6551\u3002\u6cd5\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u8ba9\u4eba\u628a\u98de\u673a\u5305\u88c5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u642c\u56de\u6cd5\u56fd\u3002\u4e00\u7fa4\u70ed\u5fc3\u4eba\u8ba1\u5212\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u67b6\u98de\u673a\u3002\u8be5\u98de\u673a\u88c5\u88c5\u914d\u67094\u53f0\u7f57\u5c14\u65af-\u7f57\u4f0a\u65af\u7684\u9ed8\u6797\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u590d\u5176\u4e2d\u76843\u53f0\u3002\u60f3\u4e00\u60f3\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u60ca\u5947\u548c\u5174\u594b \u2014\u2014 \u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u62c6\u5f00\u5305\u88c5\u7bb1\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c4\u53f0\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u5c31\u50cf\u8702\u871c\u4e00\u6837\u751c \u2014\u2014 \u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u5b8c\u597d\u65e0\u635f\u3002\u4e00\u7fa4\u871c\u8702\u628a\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u5f53\u4f5c\u4e86\u8702\u623f\uff0c\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u8702\u8721\u4e2d\u88ab\u5b8c\u6574\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e86\u4e0b\u6765\u3002    ";

In 1948, he went to lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later. This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs  and measure temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.    \u6ce2\u5170\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u54c8\u7f57\u6069.\u5854\u6377\u8036\u592b\u82b1\u4e86\u6bd5\u751f\u7684\u7cbe\u529b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u6d3b\u706b\u5c71\u548c\u63a2\u6d1e\u30021948\u5e74\u4ed6\u53bb\u4e86\u521a\u679c\u7684\u57fa\u4f0d\u6e56\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u5ea7\u540e\u6765\u88ab\u4ed6\u547d\u540d\u4e3a\u57fa\u56fe\u7f57\u7684\u65b0\u706b\u5c71\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002\u5f53\u706b\u5c71\u6b63\u5728\u731b\u70c8\u5730\u55b7\u53d1\u65f6\uff0c\u5854\u6377\u8036\u592b\u6709\u529e\u6cd5\u628a\u5e10\u7bf7\u642d\u5728\u79bb\u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u8fd1\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u8bbe\u6cd5\u62cd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5341\u5206\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5374\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u706b\u5c71\u9644\u8fd1\u505c\u7559\u592a\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u80a1\u5ca9\u6d46\u6b63\u5411\u4ed6\u6d41\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u773c\u770b\u5c31\u8981\u5c06\u4ed6\u56e2\u56e2\u56f4\u4f4f\uff0c\u4f46\u5854\u6377\u8036\u592b\u8fd8\u662f\u8bbe\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u9003\u79bb\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u7b49\u5230\u706b\u5c71\u5e73\u9759\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u4e24\u5929\u4ee5\u540e\u53c8\u8fd4\u56de\u53bb\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u4ed6\u8bbe\u6cd5\u722c\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u56fe\u7f57\u706b\u5c71\u53e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u80fd\u62cd\u6444\u7167\u7247\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002\u5854\u6377\u8036\u592b\u7ecf\u5e38\u5192\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5371\u9669\u3002\u4ed6\u80fd\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6709\u5173\u6d3b\u706b\u5c71\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u6bd4\u4efb\u4f55\u5728\u4e16\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u8981\u591a\u3002         ";

If the Houses of Parliament had hot been burned down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense size, but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock checked twice a day. On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones are connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time. A painter who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down !    \u5f53\u4f60\u6e38\u89c8\u4f26\u6566\u65f6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u770b\u5230\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e4b\u4e00\u5c31\u662f\u201c\u5927\u672c\u201d\u949f\uff0c\u5373\u90a3\u5ea7\u4ece\u82f1\u56fd\u5e7f\u64ad\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u4e2d\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u542c\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u8457\u540d\u5927\u949f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u56fd\u4f1a\u5927\u53a6\u57281834\u5e74\u88ab\u711a\u6bc1\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ea7\u5927\u949f\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5efa\u9020\u3002\u201c\u5927\u672c\u201d\u949f\u5f97\u540d\u4e8e\u672c\u6770\u660e.\u970d\u5c14\u7235\u58eb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f53\u5efa\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u56fd\u4f1a\u5927\u53a6\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u8d1f\u8d23\u5efa\u9020\u5927\u949f\u3002\u6b64\u949f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5916\u578b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8d70\u65f6\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u683c\u6797\u5c3c\u6cbb\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u7684\u5b98\u5458\u4eec\u6bcf\u5929\u4e24\u6b21\u6d3e\u4eba\u77eb\u6b63\u6b64\u949f\u3002\u5f53\u5927\u949f\u6253\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u82f1\u56fd\u5e7f\u64ad\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u4e2d\u542c\u5230\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u949f\u5854\u4e0a\u63a5\u4e86\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u3002\u201c\u5927\u672c\u201d\u949f\u5f88\u591a\u51fa\u5dee\u9519\u3002\u7136\u800c\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u5b83\u5374\u628a\u65f6\u95f4\u62a5\u9519\u3002\u5728\u949f\u5854\u4e0a\u5e72\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u4f4d\u6cb9\u6f06\u5de5\u628a\u4e00\u53ea\u6cb9\u6f06\u6876\u6302\u5728\u4e86\u4e00\u6839\u6307\u9488\u4e0a\uff0c\u628a\u949f\u5f04\u6162\u4e86\uff01          ";

He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird, the car he was driving, had been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2500 horse-power engine. Although Campbell reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour, he had great difficulty in controlling the car because a tyre burst during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour. However, a few days later, he was told that a mistake had been made. His average speed had been 301 miles per hour. Since that time, racing drivers have reached speeds of over 400 miles an hour. Following  his father's footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolm's son, Donald, also set up a world record. Like his father, he was driving a car called Bluebird.         \u6770\u51fa\u7684\u8d5b\u8f66\u9009\u624b\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u59c6.\u574e\u8d1d\u5c14\u7235\u58eb\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7300\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9a7e\u8f66\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u4e8e1935\u5e749\u6708\u5728\u72b9\u4ed6\u5dde\u7684\u90a6\u7eb3\u7ef4\u5c14\u76d0\u6ee9\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002\u4ed6\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u201c\u84dd\u9e1f\u201d\u724c\u6c7d\u8f66\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u4ed6\u5236\u9020\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u8f66\u8eab\u957f30\u82f1\u5c3a\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a2,500 \u9a6c\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u574e\u8d1d\u5c14\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7304\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5f88\u96be\u628a\u6c7d\u8f66\u63a7\u5236\u4f4f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u884c\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7206\u4e86\u4e00\u53ea\u8f6e\u80ce\u3002\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u574e\u8d1d\u5c14\u975e\u5e38\u5931\u671b\u5730\u5f97\u77e5\u4ed6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u901f\u662f299\u82f1\u91cc\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u51e0\u5929\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u8bf4\u5f04\u9519\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u901f\u5b9e\u9645\u662f301\u82f1\u91cc\u3002\u4ece\u90a3\u65f6\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u8d5b\u8f66\u9009\u624b\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6600\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u5e74\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u59c6\u7235\u58eb\u7684\u513f\u5b50\u5510\u7eb3\u5fb7\u8e0f\u7740\u7236\u4eb2\u7684\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e5f\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u4e16\u754c\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002\u540c\u4ed6\u7236\u4eb2\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e5f\u9a7e\u9a76\u7740\u4e00\u8f86\u540d\u53eb\u201c\u84dd\u9e1f\u201d\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u3002        ";

A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get. They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1600 miles. He hitch- hiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep. When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the meantime, travelled to Calais. No one noticed the boy as he crept off. From there, he hitch-hiked to Paris in a lorry. The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city. The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border. There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities. He has surely set up a record for the thousands of boys who dream of evading school.   \u9003\u5b66\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u90fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60f3\u50cf\u529b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u81f3\u591a\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5b89\u9759\u5730\u9493\u4e0a\u4e00\u5929\u9c7c\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u7535\u5f71\u9662\u91cc\u5750\u4e0a8\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u904d\u904d\u5730\u770b\u540c\u4e00\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u3002\u800c\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u9003\u5b66\u671f\u95f4\u65c5\u884c\u4e861,600\u82f1\u91cc\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6240\u6709\u9003\u5b66\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u90fd\u76f8\u5f62\u89c1\u7ecc\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u642d\u4fbf\u8f66\u5230\u4e86\u591a\u4f5b\uff0c\u5929\u5feb\u9ed1\u65f6\u94bb\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8239\uff0c\u60f3\u627e\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u7761\u89c9\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u4ed6\u9192\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8239\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5df2\u7ecf\u5230\u4e86\u52a0\u3002\u5f53\u7537\u5b69\u4ece\u8239\u91cc\u722c\u51fa\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u8c01\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u4ed6\u3002\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u53c8\u642d\u4e0a\u5361\u8f66\u5230\u4e86\u5df4\u9ece\u3002\u53f8\u673a\u7ed9\u4e86\u4ed6\u51e0\u5757\u997c\u5e72\u548c\u4e00\u676f\u5496\u5561\uff0c\u5c31\u628a\u4ed6\u4e22\u5728\u4e86\u57ce\u5916\u3002\u7537\u5b69\u622a\u4f4f\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u50cf\u4ed6\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u90a3\u6837\u628a\u4ed6\u5e26\u5230\u5df4\u9ece\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u628a\u4ed6\u5e26\u5230\u4e86\u6cd5\u56fd\u548c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u4f69\u76ae\u5c3c\u6602\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u90a3\u513f\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u8b66\u5bdf\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u88ab\u5f53\u5c40\u9001\u56de\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u3002\u4ed6\u65e0\u7591\u4e3a\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u68a6\u60f3\u9003\u907f\u4e0a\u5b66\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002        ";

When it grew dark. she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small. Early ,next morning she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal. Then she had an idea. She stamped out the letters' SOS' in the snow. Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.

Here you can see two workers who, between them, have just finished cutting three cart-loads of golden brown  macaroni stalks. The whole village has been working day and night gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September rains. On the right, you can see Mrs Brabante herself. She has been helping her husband for thirty years now. Mrs Brabante is talking to the manager of the local  factory where the crop is processed.

The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate. The operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin. The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory.

I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette. For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered terribly. I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite. My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket. After seven days of this I went to a party. Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear. I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.

The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world, for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to see it. A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world. There was also a great deal of machinery on display. The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam hammer. Though in those days, travelling was not as easy as it is today, steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe. On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train. There were six million visitors in all, and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges. Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.   19\u4e16\u7eaa\u6700\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u4e5f\u8bb8\u8981\u6570\u6c34\u6676\u5bab\u4e86\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e3a1851\u5e74\u7684\u201c\u4e16\u754c\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u201d\u800c\u5efa\u5728\u6d77\u5fb7\u516c\u56ed\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5ea7\u6c34\u6676\u5bab\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u7528\u94a2\u548c\u73bb\u7483\u5efa\u6210\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u6700\u9ad8\u5927\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4ece\u5404\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7eb7\u7eb7\u524d\u6765\u53c2\u89c2\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u4ece\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u8fd0\u9001\u5230\u4e86\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\uff0c\u53c2\u5c55\u7684\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u5947\u5999\u7684\u662f\u5185\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af\u7684\u84b8\u6c7d\u9524\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5f53\u65f6\u65c5\u884c\u4e0d\u50cf\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u4e48\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u4f46\u6c7d\u8239\u8fd8\u662f\u628a\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u53c2\u89c2\u8005\u4ece\u6b27\u6d32\u5927\u9646\u9001\u8fc7\u4e86\u82f1\u5409\u5229\u6d77\u5ce1\u3002\u4e00\u5230\u82f1\u56fd\uff0c\u706b\u8f66\u5c31\u628a\u4ed6\u4eec\u9001\u5230\u4e86\u6c34\u6676\u5bab\u3002\u53c2\u89c2\u7684\u4eba\u6570\u603b\u5171\u662f600\u4e07\u3002\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u7684\u8d62\u5229\u7528\u6765\u5efa\u9020\u535a\u7269\u9986\u548c\u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821\u3002\u540e\u6765\uff0c\u201c\u6c34\u6676\u5bab\u201d\u88ab\u79fb\u5230\u4e86\u4f26\u6566\u5357\u90e8\u3002\u57281936\u5e74\u88ab\u711a\u6bc1\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5b83\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u8457\u540d\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002    ";

Lights were blazing and men were running here and there: they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped. At that moment, a large black car with four officers inside it, stopped at the camp gates. The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed. When they had gone, the driver of the car came towards him. The man obviously wanted to talk. He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue eyes. The prisoner felt sorry for him, but there was nothing else he could do. As the man came near, the prisoner knocked him to the ground with a sharp blow. Then, jumping into the car, he drove off as quickly as he could.    \u90a3\u4e2a\u6218\u4fd8\u6740\u6b7b\u536b\u5175\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u8fc5\u901f\u5730\u628a\u5c38\u4f53\u62d6\u8fdb\u4e86\u704c\u6728\u4e1b\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u9ed1\u6697\u4e2d\u5fd9\u6d3b\u4e86\u4e00\u9635\u513f\uff0c\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u6362\u4e0a\u4e86\u6b7b\u8005\u7684\u8863\u670d\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u8eab\u7a7f\u84dd\u519b\u88c5\uff0c\u80a9\u625b\u6b65\u67aa\uff0c\u5728\u519b\u8425\u95e8\u524d\u5927\u80c6\u5730\u6765\u56de\u8d70\u770b\u3002\u4ed6\u542c\u5f97\u519b\u8425\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u55a7\u95f9\u58f0\u3002\u90a3\u91cc\u706f\u7c73\u901a\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u4e1c\u5954\u897f\u8dd1\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u521a\u521a\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fd8\u864f\u8dd1\u4e86\u3002\u6b63\u5728\u6b64\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u8f86\u9ed1\u8272\u5927\u8f7f\u8f66\u5728\u519b\u8425\u95e8\u53e3\u505c\u4e86\u4e0b\u6765\u3002\u91cc\u9762\u5750\u4e864\u4e2a\u519b\u5b98\u3002\u519b\u5b98\u4eec\u4e0b\u4e86\u8f66\uff0c\u6218\u4fd8\u7acb\u6b63\u7ad9\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u4ed6\u9762\u524d\u7ecf\u8fc7\u65f6\u656c\u4e86\u793c\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8d70\u540e\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u53f8\u673a\u5411\u4ed6\u8d70\u6765\uff0c\u8fd9\u4eba\u663e\u7136\u662f\u60f3\u804a\u5929\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0a\u4e86\u5e74\u7eaa\uff0c\u6709\u7740\u7070\u767d\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u548c\u660e\u4eae\u7684\u84dd\u773c\u775b\u3002\u6218\u4fd8\u4e3a\u4ed6\u611f\u5230\u60cb\u60dc\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d70\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0c\u6218\u4fd8\u4e00\u62f3\u628a\u4ed6\u6253\u5012\u5728\u5730\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8df3\u8fdb\u8f66\u91cc\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u628a\u8f66\u5f00\u8d70\u4e86\u3002  ";

Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen, it is now known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures  are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar. A small fishing-boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line. Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long. It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail, The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish. Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.   \u6e14\u592b\u548c\u6c34\u624b\u4eec\u6709\u65f6\u58f0\u79f0\u81ea\u5df1\u770b\u5230\u8fc7\u6d77\u91cc\u7684\u5996\u602a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u4eec\u5e38\u5e38\u5bf9\u6c34\u624b\u4eec\u8bb2\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u4ed8\u8bf8\u4e00\u7b11\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u770b\u6765\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u6709\u65f6\u770b\u5230\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u201c\u5996\u602a\u201d\u5f88\u591a\u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u4e9b\u5947\u602a\u7684\u9c7c\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5076\u5c14\u4f1a\u88ab\u51b2\u5230\u5cb8\u4e0a\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6d77\u4e0a\u5374\u6781\u5c11\u80fd\u88ab\u6355\u5230\u3002\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u4e45\u524d\uff0c\u5728\u9a6c\u8fbe\u52a0\u65af\u52a0\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6d77\u91cc\u5374\u6355\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5947\u602a\u7684\u9c7c\u3002\u4e00\u6761\u5c0f\u6e14\u8239\u88ab\u4e00\u6761\u54ac\u4f4f\u94a9\u7684\u5f3a\u58ee\u7684\u5927\u9c7c\u62d6\u5230\u4e86\u51e0\u82f1\u91cc\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u6d77\u9762\u4e0a\u3002\u90a3\u4f4d\u6e14\u6c11\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u6761\u666e\u901a\u7684\u9c7c\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u5343\u65b9\u767e\u8ba1\u4e0d\u8ba9\u5b83\u53d7\u5230\u4e1d\u6beb\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u5f53\u7ec8\u4e8e\u628a\u5b83\u5f04\u4e0a\u5cb8\u540e\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u8eab\u957f\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e8613\u82f1\u5c3a\u3002\u5b83\u957f\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u50cf\u9a6c\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u5934\uff0c\u6709\u7740\u5927\u7684\u84dd\u773c\u775b\u548c\u95ea\u95ea\u53d1\u5149\u7684\u94f6\u8272\u76ae\u80a4\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u9c9c\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u5c3e\u5df4\u3002\u6b64\u9c7c\u53eb\u6868\u9c7c\uff0c\u88ab\u9001\u8fdb\u4e86\u535a\u7269\u9986\uff0c\u73b0\u6b63\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4f4d\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u6d3b\u7740\u7684\u8fd9\u7c7b\u52a8\u7269\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u751f\u6d3b\u5728600\u82f1\u5c3a\u6df1\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u3002         ";

Meanwhile, a number of university students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts.

The speed-boat had struck a buoy, but it continued to move very quickly across the water. Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore. when they noticed with dismay that the speed-boat was moving in a circle. It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed. In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away. After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return. They had just had enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle. On this occasion, however, it had slowed down considerably. The petrol had nearly all been used up.

As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with the closest relatives.

It was mainly for this reason that the Brazilian government decided to have a new city built 600 miles north-west of Rio de Janeiro. Designed by the great architect Lucio Costa, the new city, Brasilia, replaced Rio de Janeiro as the capital of Brazif in 1960. Brasilia has been carefully planned for modern living. Its wide roads, which can take fourteen lanes of traffic, have been kept  away from living areas. Children do not have to cross busy streets to go to school. Housewives can visit-shopping centres on foot, for in these specially designed living areas, cars are unnecessary. At first, the government had great difficulty in persuading people to leave Rio and to settle in Brasilia. Since 1960, however, the population has been growing all the time. Brasilia has quickly established itself as the capital of the country. The idea to have the capital moved so far inland will have a great effect on the future of Brazil.   \u6cb9\u714e\u9c7c\u52a0\u70b8\u571f\u8c46\u7247\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u4eba\u559c\u7231\u7684\u4e00\u9053\u83dc\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u968f\u7740\u6d77\u6d0b\u91cc\u7684\u6ee5\u6355\u6ee5\u635e\uff0c\u9c7c\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u542c\u8bf4\u5317\u6d77\u77f3\u6cb9\u94bb\u4e95\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u6c34\u5458\u53d7\u5230\u5de8\u578b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u7684\u6050\u5413\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u5f88\u8ba9\u4eba\u5403\u60ca\u3002\u94bb\u4e95\u5e73\u53f0\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u5e38\u4fee\u7406\uff0c\u6f5c\u6c34\u5458\u5e38\u5e38\u8981\u5728\u6c34\u9762100\u82f1\u5c3a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6478\u9ed1\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u66fe\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u88ab\u649e\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u8eab\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u9c7c\u5413\u5f97\u60ca\u60f6\u5931\u63aa\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u4e86\u7279\u5236\u7684\u7b3c\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ed6\u4eec\u514d\u53d7\u5927\u9c7c\u7684\u4fb5\u88ad\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9c7c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u9ca8\u9c7c\u6216\u9006\u621f\u9cb8\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6df1\u53d7\u4eba\u4eec\u559c\u7231\u7684\u98df\u7528\u9c7c\u54c1\u79cd\uff0c\u5982\u9cd5\u9c7c\u548c\u9cd0\u9c7c\uff0c\u53ea\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5b83\u4eec\u957f\u5f97\u51fa\u5947\u5730\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u957f\u8fbe12\u82f1\u5c3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9c7c\u80fd\u957f\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e48\u5927\u662f\u75313\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u9020\u6210\u7684\uff1a\u6d77\u5e95\u70ed\u7684\u8f93\u6cb9\u7ba1\u9053\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u6d77\u6c34\uff1b\u94bb\u4e95\u5e73\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u629b\u5230\u6d77\u91cc\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u98df\u7269\uff1b\u94bb\u4e95\u5e73\u53f0\u5468\u56f4\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u6709\u6355\u9c7c\u8239\u53ea\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9c7c\u5c31\u5728\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u6c34\u6d41\u4e2d\u5403\u5440\u5403\uff0c\u957f\u5440\u957f\u3002\u7a76\u7adf\u8c01\u5403\u8c01\u5462\uff1f      ";

The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news, because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft. He said that someone might by spying on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object. The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time. He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding field-glasses. When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs. Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.

The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete. The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall, had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.   \u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u8457\u540d\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5973\u795e\u96d5\u50cf\u662f\u572819\u4e16\u7eaa\u65f6\u7531\u6cd5\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u8d60\u9001\u7ed9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5ea7\u7531\u96d5\u50cf\u5bb6\u5965\u53e4\u65af\u7279.\u5df4\u7d22\u5c14\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u96d5\u50cf\u662f\u752810\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u96d5\u50cf\u523b\u6210\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5ea7\u96d5\u50cf\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u662f\u7528\u94dc\u5236\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u7531\u827e\u83f2\u5c14\u7279\u5236\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6491\u7740\u3002\u5728\u96d5\u50cf\u88ab\u8fd0\u5f80\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a\u5b83\u9009\u597d\u4e00\u5757\u573a\u5730\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5fc5\u987b\u5efa\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u5ea7\u3002\u573a\u5730\u9009\u5728\u4e86\u7ebd\u7ea6\u6e2f\u5165\u53e3\u5904\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9e1f\u4e0a\u3002\u52301884\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u5ea7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fbe151\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u96d5\u50cf\u5728\u5df4\u9ece\u7ad6\u7acb\u8d77\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e74\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u62c6\u6210\u82e5\u5e72\u5c0f\u5757\uff0c\u8fd0\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u3002\u52301886\u5e7410\u6708\u5e95\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ea7\u96d5\u50cf\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u88c5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u7531\u5df4\u7d22\u5c14\u5730\u6b63\u5f0f\u8d60\u9001\u7ed9\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u3002\u4ece\u90a3\u65f6\u8d77\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ea7\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u5bf9\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebd\u7ea6\u6e2f\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b9a\u5c45\u7684\u5343\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\u5c31\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u8c61\u5f81\u3002    ";

At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water, It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water. The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them. Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.   \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u5728\u5f88\u5c0f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6e38\u6cf3\u3002\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u8bbe\u7684\u6e38\u6cf3\u6c60\u91cc\uff0c\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5b66\u4f1a\u8d70\u8def\u65f6\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u719f\u7ec3\u5730\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u5c4f\u4f4f\u547c\u5438\u4e86\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u5a74\u513f\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u5f97\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u5165\u6c34\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f88\u5feb\u4fbf\u9002\u5e94\u4e86\u6e38\u6cf3\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f4\u80fd\u6361\u8d77\u6c60\u5e95\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e7c\u5c0f\u7684\u6e38\u6cf3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u7231\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66\u5e76\u6392\u653e\u57287\u82f1\u5c3a\u6df1\u7684\u6e38\u6cf3\u6c60\u5e95\u4e0a\u3002\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u6bd4\u8d5b\u770b\u8c01\u5148\u5230\u8fbe\u6e38\u6cf3\u6c60\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u7aef\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u5b69\u5b50\u7528\u811a\u8e6c\u8f66\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u5b69\u5b50\u66f4\u613f\u610f\u63a8\u6216\u662f\u62c9\u7740\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u5b69\u5b50\u80fd\u591f\u8dd1\u5b8c\u6e38\u6cf3\u6c60\u7684\u5168\u957f\u800c\u4e0d\u7528\u9732\u51fa\u6c34\u9762\u6362\u6c14\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u6765\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7684\u51a0\u519b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u4f5c\u51fa\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u4e2d\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\u6e38\u4e0d\u4e865\u7801\u5c31\u5df2\u5598\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6c14\u6765\u7684\u4eba\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u79cd\u9f13\u821e\u3002             ";

This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their  return journey to the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.  \u65e5\u672c\u6bcf\u5e74\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u201c\u4ea1\u7075\u8282\u201d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8282\u65e5\u662f\u4e2a\u6b22\u4e50\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u636e\u8bf4\u6b7b\u53bb\u7684\u4eba\u8981\u56de\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5bb6\u91cc\u6765\uff0c\u6d3b\u7740\u7684\u4eba\u5219\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u8868\u793a\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u6599\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u957f\u9014\u65c5\u884c\u4e4b\u540e\u4f1a\u611f\u5230\u9965\u997f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u6446\u653e\u597d\u4e86\u98df\u54c1\u3002\u7279\u5236\u7684\u706f\u7b3c\u6302\u5728\u5404\u5bb6\u7684\u95e8\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u7684\u662f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ea1\u7075\u770b\u6e05\u9053\u8def\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u591c\u665a\u4eba\u4eec\u8f7d\u6b4c\u8f7d\u821e\u3002\u4e00\u5927\u65e9\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4fbf\u628a\u4e3a\u6b7b\u8005\u6446\u653e\u7684\u98df\u54c1\u6254\u8fdb\u6cb3\u4e2d\u6216\u6d77\u91cc\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6d3b\u7740\u7684\u4eba\u5403\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u662f\u4e0d\u5409\u5229\u7684\u3002\u5728\u9760\u6d77\u7684\u57ce\u9547\u4e2d\uff0c\u5934\u5929\u591c\u91cc\u6302\u5728\u5927\u8857\u5c0f\u5df7\u7684\u5c0f\u706f\u7b3c\u5728\u8282\u540e\u5c31\u653e\u5728\u4e86\u6c34\u91cc\u3002\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u53ea\u706f\u7b3c\u6162\u6162\u6f02\u5411\u5927\u6d77\uff0c\u6307\u5f15\u7740\u4ea1\u7075\u8fd4\u56de\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u611f\u4eba\u7684\u573a\u9762\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u6210\u7fa4\u5730\u4f2b\u7acb\u5728\u6d77\u5cb8\u4e0a\uff0c\u6ce8\u89c6\u7740\u706f\u7b3c\u8fdc\u53bb\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u518d\u4e5f\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002  ";
